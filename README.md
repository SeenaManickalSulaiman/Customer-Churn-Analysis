# **Customer-Churn-Analysis**

Customer churn analysis is the process of identifying and understanding why customers stop using a company's products or services. This analysis is crucial for both retail and commercial segments as it helps businesses predict and mitigate customer churn, ultimately improving customer retention and profitability.

## **Key Components of Customer Churn Analysis**
1.	**Data Collection**: Gather data on customer behavior, transactions, and interactions. This can include purchase history, customer feedback, and engagement metrics.
2.	**Segmentation:** Divide customers into segments based on their behavior and characteristics. Common methods include the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and K-Means clustering
3.	**Churn Prediction:** Use statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn. This involves analyzing patterns and trends in the data
4.	**Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the reasons behind customer churn. This can involve analyzing customer feedback, market trends, and competitive actions.
5.	**Mitigation Strategies:** Develop strategies to retain customers. This can include personalized marketing, loyalty programs, improved customer service, and targeted promotions.

## **Benefits of Customer Churn Analysis**

•	**Improved Customer Retention**: By understanding why customers leave, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them.

•	**Cost Savings**: Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

•	**Enhanced Customer Experience**: Identifying pain points allows businesses to improve their products and services.

•	**Informed Decision-Making**: Data-driven insights help businesses allocate resources more effectively and make strategic decisions.

## **The Impact of Customer Churn on Businesses**
Customer churn significantly impacts companies, especially Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses, due to high customer acquisition costs. Churn affects Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) businesses differently, with B2C experiencing higher rates due to easier subscription changes. B2B churn is more impactful due to fewer, high-value customers. Churn can demoralize staff and distract from serving existing customers. There are two types of churn: voluntary (customer choice) and involuntary (external factors). Companies should measure churn rates regularly and use metrics like Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Effort Score (CES) to gauge customer satisfaction. Predictive and preventive churn models, survival analysis, and anomaly detection help forecast and mitigate churn. Reducing churn involves identifying at-risk customers, investing in customer success, providing excellent service, fair pricing, and strong loyalty programs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance churn management through better data analysis, predictive analytics, and improved customer support.

# **Maths Behind Customer Survival Analysis**

The probability of surviving at least to time \( t \) is given by the **survival function** \( S(t) \), which is defined as:

\[
S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F(t)
\]

where:

- \( F(t) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF), defined as:

  \[
  F(t) = P(T \leq t) = \int_0^t f(u) \, du
  \]

- \( f(t) \) is the probability density function (PDF).

Thus, the survival function can also be expressed as:

\[
S(t) = \int_t^{\infty} f(u) \, du.
\]

Method 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve
The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from time-to-event data. It is especially useful when dealing with censored data, where some subjects do not experience the event by the end of the study period.

The Kaplan-Meier survival function is defined as:

𝑆

∏

S(t)= 
i=1
∏

​
 (1−

​

 )
where:

𝑆
(

)
S(t) is the estimated probability of surviving beyond time 
𝑡
t.
𝑑

d

​
  is the number of events (e.g., deaths, failures) at time 
𝑡

​
 .
𝑛

n

​
  is the number of individuals at risk just before 
𝑡
𝑖
t 
i
​
  (including those who will experience the event at 
𝑡
𝑖
t 
i
​
 ).
How the Kaplan-Meier Estimator Works:
The timeline is divided based on observed event times.
At each event time 
𝑡
𝑖
t 
i
​
 , the survival probability is updated using the formula above.
If no event occurs at a given time, the survival probability remains unchanged.
Censored observations (where the event is not observed) do not contribute to the numerator but are removed from the denominator in subsequent calculations.
