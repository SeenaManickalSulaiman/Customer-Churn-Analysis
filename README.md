# **Customer-Churn-Analysis**

Customer churn analysis is the process of identifying and understanding why customers stop using a company's products or services. This analysis is crucial for both retail and commercial segments as it helps businesses predict and mitigate customer churn, ultimately improving customer retention and profitability.

## **Key Components of Customer Churn Analysis**
1.	**Data Collection**: Gather data on customer behavior, transactions, and interactions. This can include purchase history, customer feedback, and engagement metrics.
2.	**Segmentation:** Divide customers into segments based on their behavior and characteristics. Common methods include the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and K-Means clustering
3.	**Churn Prediction:** Use statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn. This involves analyzing patterns and trends in the data
4.	**Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the reasons behind customer churn. This can involve analyzing customer feedback, market trends, and competitive actions.
5.	**Mitigation Strategies:** Develop strategies to retain customers. This can include personalized marketing, loyalty programs, improved customer service, and targeted promotions.

## **Benefits of Customer Churn Analysis**

•	**Improved Customer Retention**: By understanding why customers leave, businesses can take proactive steps to retain them.

•	**Cost Savings**: Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

•	**Enhanced Customer Experience**: Identifying pain points allows businesses to improve their products and services.

•	**Informed Decision-Making**: Data-driven insights help businesses allocate resources more effectively and make strategic decisions.

## **The Impact of Customer Churn on Businesses**
Customer churn significantly impacts companies, especially Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) businesses, due to high customer acquisition costs. Churn affects Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) businesses differently, with B2C experiencing higher rates due to easier subscription changes. B2B churn is more impactful due to fewer, high-value customers. Churn can demoralize staff and distract from serving existing customers. There are two types of churn: voluntary (customer choice) and involuntary (external factors). Companies should measure churn rates regularly and use metrics like Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Effort Score (CES) to gauge customer satisfaction. Predictive and preventive churn models, survival analysis, and anomaly detection help forecast and mitigate churn. Reducing churn involves identifying at-risk customers, investing in customer success, providing excellent service, fair pricing, and strong loyalty programs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance churn management through better data analysis, predictive analytics, and improved customer support.

# **Maths Behind it**

If time to event has the probability density function $f(t)$ and cumulative distribution function $F(t)$, then the probability of surviving at least to time $t$ is: $Pr(T>t)=S(t)=1-F(t)$. 

Cumulative hazard at time t is defined as $H(t)=-ln(S(t))$ and instantaneous hazard at time $t$ is $h(t)=\frac{dH(t)}{dt}$. The instantateous hazard can also be written as $h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$

The likelihood function for survival analysis is described as:

$$ l(\beta) = \prod_{n=1}^{n} h(t_{i})^{d_{i}} S(t_{i}) $$
where $d_i$ is the censoring variable that equals to 1 if the event is observed for individual $i$ and 0 if the event is not observed (censored) for individual $i$, $h(t_i)$ is the hazard for individual $i$ at time $t$, $H(t_i)$ is the cumulative hazard for individual $i$ at time $t$, and $S(t_i)$ is the survival probability for individual $i$ at time $t$. Note that when $d_i=0$, the contribution of the $i$'th individual to the likelihood function is just its survival probability until time $t$: S(t). If the individual has the event, the contribution to the likelihood function is given by the density function $f(t)=h(t)S(t)$.

The log of likelihood is:

$$ logl(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i log(h(t_i)) - H(t_i) $$
where $log$ is the natural logarithm.

# Survival Analysis

This repository contains information and code related to survival analysis, including the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, survival function, cumulative hazard, and instantaneous hazard.

## Key Concepts

### Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- **PDF**: \( f(t) \)
- **CDF**: \( F(t) \)

### Survival Function
The probability of surviving at least to time \( t \) is given by:
\[ Pr(T > t) = S(t) = 1 - F(t) \]

### Cumulative Hazard
The cumulative hazard at time \( t \) is defined as:
\[ H(t) = -\ln(S(t)) \]

### Instantaneous Hazard
The instantaneous hazard at time \( t \) is:
\[ h(t) = \frac{dH(t)}{dt} \]
It can also be written as:
\[ h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} \]

## Likelihood Function for Survival Analysis
The likelihood function for survival analysis is described as:
\[ l(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} h(t_{i})^{d_{i}} S(t_{i}) \]
where:
- \( d_i \) is the censoring variable that equals 1 if the event is observed for individual \( i \) and 0 if the event is not observed (censored) for individual \( i \).
- \( h(t_i) \) is the hazard for individual \( i \) at time \( t \).
- \( H(t_i) \) is the cumulative hazard for individual \( i \) at time \( t \).
- \( S(t_i) \) is the survival probability for individual \( i \) at time \( t \).

Note that when \( d_i = 0 \), the contribution of the \( i \)-th individual to the likelihood function is just its survival probability until time \( t \): \( S(t) \). If the individual has the event, the contribution to the likelihood function is given by the density function \( f(t) = h(t)S(t) \).

## Log-Likelihood Function
The log of the likelihood function is:
\[ \log l(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i \log(h(t_i)) - H(t_i) \]
where \( \log \) is the natural logarithm.
